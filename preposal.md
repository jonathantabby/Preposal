# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm probably going to do a simulation of some sort. I don't really have a specific idea in mind, but I'm looking at different websites that have examples of ideas.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this an appropriate idea? Would you suggest doing something similar to --but not-- this?
