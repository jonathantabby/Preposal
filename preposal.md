# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm probably going to do a simulation of some sort. The simulation will involve using data to predict future events, such as stock prices.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this an appropriate idea? Would you suggest doing something similar to --but not-- this?
