# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

PONG

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Table tennisâ€“themed arcade video game. Players hit the ball in hopes of scoring in the opponent's "net".

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the right side of the screen.  Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for the player to reach eleven points before the opponent. Points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other side.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I'll submit a game that functions properly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding appropriate sound effects.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A colorful "explosion" when the ball hits the "paddles." Making a single-player AI version.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to research pygame. For the AI, I will have to learn how to make the opponent's paddle work on its own and react to changing user inputs.
